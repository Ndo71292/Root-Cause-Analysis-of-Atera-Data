# Root-Cause-Analysis-of-Atera-Data
## Introduction:
In today's technology-driven landscape, businesses rely heavily on complex systems and devices to operate seamlessly. The occurrence of technical issues and incidents can disrupt operations and impact customer satisfaction. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a critical process that seeks to uncover the underlying factors responsible for such issues, enabling organizations to take proactive measures and enhance the overall system reliability. In this project, we aim to leverage data-driven techniques to perform RCA using clustering, focusing on machine agents and alerts data.

## The Scope
The scope of this project encompasses the analysis of machine agents' information and alerts data. The focus will be on performing Root Cause Analysis using clustering techniques to identify common technical issues and patterns based on machine agents and alerts.

## Deliverables:
1. Data Integration and Preparation: Merge machine agents and alerts data to create a consolidated dataset for analysis.

2. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant numerical features from machine agents and alerts data to build a feature-rich representation for clustering.

3. Clustering Analysis: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to group similar alerts and machine agents based on the combined features.

4. Cluster Visualization: Visualize the resulting clusters to understand their composition and distribution.

5. Root Cause Identification: Analyze clusters to identify common technical issues, patterns, and potential root causes based on machine agents and alerts data.

6. Insights and Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the identified root causes to improve technical operations and system reliability.

## Objectives:
1. Comprehensive Understanding: Gain a holistic understanding of technical events (machine agents and alerts) to enhance system reliability.

2. Common Issue Identification: Identify common technical patterns and issues faced by the systems and devices.

3. Root Cause Discovery: Uncover potential root causes behind recurring technical issues by examining the composition of clusters.

4. Proactive Measures: Provide actionable insights to enable organizations to take proactive measures, prevent future incidents, and enhance system reliability.
